### **Step 2: Configure AI Settings**

Edit `backend/config/ai_config.php`:

```php
return [
    'enabled' => true, // Set to true to enable AI features
    'services' => [
        'google_vision' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'api_key' => 'YOUR_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY_HERE', // Optional
            'free_tier_limit' => 1000, // 1000 free requests per month
        ],
        'hugging_face' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'api_key' => '', // Works without API key for basic models
        ]
    ],
    // ... rest of config
];
```
